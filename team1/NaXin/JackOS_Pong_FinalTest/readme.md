# This file is the final test for JackOS

The final test runs the pong game. Using the .jack file have been writen.

## in the pong folder
you will see the .vm files for pong

## issue
I didn't put my own Screen.vm in it, because if using the file I wrtie myself, The game will be very slow.
I think the cause to this problem is not the screen.jack is too slow.
Maybe the problem of the VMEmulator, because it's a java program and can't be that fast
but using the built-in screen.class, the speed will be ok. I think it's because it didn't work though the Emulator.
