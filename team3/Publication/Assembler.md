## Intro

Congratulations! We really appreciate your comprehension which enables you to implement PC and learn that complicated hack machine language.  However, one must be aware of the fact that we create machine language because our PC is, at this moment, foolish and cannot comprehend our thoughts.

*So what can we do? We cannot just leave it like this.* 

Let us not **forget**, my friends, that we were once the same foolish as our machine is, when we were kids. But now we are not anymore, not just because we *learnt things*, but because we were *guided to learn* as well.

That's why in this chapter we will ***focus*** on ***how a machine can learn***, and ***by what means we can  guide it***.

#### How can a machine learn?

To answer this question we must first try to figure out the answer to the other one. That is: **"How can we learn?"**

Unfortunately we are not able to give you a perfect answer because of the complicated mechanism of learning inside our brain. But it's okay for us to suppose that when you learn something, there must be a  **physical evidence** in your organism. For us, it might be a curve in our brain; for machine, it can be a new chip added or a new function implemented.

~~***(One critical advantage we have over machine now is that this physcial improvement can be made by ourselves. A machine cannot optimize its hardware by itself, at least for now(。・・)ノ.)***~~

#### By what means can we guide it?





### Assembly



You might have noticed by now that when we were trying to teach you  machine language, we've given a great deal of names to those "1"s and "0"s such as"A-instructions", "C-instructions", "comp field", "jump field", etc.

**-"WHY? "**

-"Because it helps us understand? "

**-"Correct! But HOW? " **

Now we are talking.

Names, or to be more accurate, symbols, provide abstraction. Abstraction stands for connection. A symbol that refers to a group of certain elements creates sequence and order. Instead of memorizing ***all*** the details, we just need to understand ***each*** one of them, and build a symbol table to refer to when necessary. Moreover, if the symbol table can be read and carried out by our machine, we will need to manufacture those hard works no more.
