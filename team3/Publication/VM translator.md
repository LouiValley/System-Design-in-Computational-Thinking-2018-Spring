#VM translator

##Intro

If you are reading this chapter, you will have finished creating an assembler. Congratulations on creating your first translator! Over the course of reading this book, you will realise that compting, from the bare-bones hardware, all the way to the most complicated algorithms, is just a series of translations. By knowing how these tranlations work, you will hold the secret to understanding ***all*** computing systems. *Some* of these translations are absolutely neccesary for the computer to be able to work. In the case of the hack computer, we have to create a translation from machine code to basic boolean logic, so that when given an instruction, our ALU will be able to complete a calculation and give us an output. Sometimes, however, a translation is not an integral part of the system's function, but rather an aid to us mere humans. They are introduced at some point, to make life easier for whoever's job it is to work with these translations.
