# Preface



***Don't think you are. Know you are.***

## Purpose

***--"What is this book?"***

--"This is a textbook, of course? A textbook of this course, you know."

***--"What makes you think this is a textbook? You haven't even read a bit of it yet."***

--"Well, if you put it that way. What is it then?"

***--"We do not know the answer to that question, and that's exactly why the question was asked."***

--"Wait a minute. Were you just saying that you don't even know what you've written? How is that possible?"

***--"A book read by no one is no book at all. It's only a purpose."***

--"What purpose?"

***--"The same purpose for which you took this course."***

***--"Look. This might sound a little weird, but we are sure there is a purpose much more powerful than just getting credits and knowledge that drives you here. In the past you might have been a person who accepted what you saw, being cheated and controlled by the world because you were expecting to wake up. Now your expectation leads you here, to this book, while the book is also looking for you. And now it's time to find out if it is true."***

--"Well, even if I believe you, how do you know this book is gonna wake me up?"

***--"We don't. But you will. And by the time you do, we will know too."***

## Course

This book is designed for and based on the course ***Computational thinking and system design***. One can gain critical knowledge not only for computer structure from hardware to software, but for the thinking and self-optimizing methods as well. Readers are required to have basic reading and calculating ability, and know at least one programming language (not really necessary).

## Structure

This book is divided into three separated chapters: **Hardware**, **Language and Software**, and **Translators**. The recommended sequence is not necessary while you are learning.

For every chapter and every section of a chapter we provided a logic model, to summarize the learning process and help you figure out the complete learn-and-know procedure. Remember, our logic model is only a guidance. Your own logic model could be quite different, and we are expecting that.

Building a modern computer from the very beginning is a huge and complicated project. One should be aware of which stage he is at in the procedure, and why is that necessary. To help the readers concentrate on each stage and summarize what they've learnt in the correct way, a logic model is needed.
